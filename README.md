# Cool attributes !

A very basic mod for Minecraft 1.12.2 that adds 2 custom attributes:

Every attribute start with `cool-attributes`.
- `.lifeStealPercentage`: Heals the player x% of the damage they deal to a mob.
- `.outOfWorldPercentage`: When a mob is damaged by the player, the mob will take an extra x% of the damage dealt but as Out of World damage type (Bypasses the mob's armor)

These attributes range from 0.0 to 1.0 (0 to 100%) <br>
*Mob refers to a living entity, like a player or a monster.* 

**Examples:**

If the player has a `.lifeStealPercentage` of 0.5, and they deal 5 damage to a mob, they will heal 2.5 HP.<br>
If the player has a `.outOfWorldPercentage` of 0.2, and they deal 10 damage to a mob, the mob will take an extra 2 damage but as Out of World damage.
